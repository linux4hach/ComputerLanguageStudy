# ComputerLanguageStudy
This is a freemind project that I am using to make a systematic noteset on programming languages as I have time.  Freemind is a 
mindmapping" software that is written in java that makes it easy to make such notes.  It produces an xml document that encapsulates what it
produces in a text format.
